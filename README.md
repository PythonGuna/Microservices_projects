  Distributed Image Management System with Python, Docker, and RabbitMQ Integration



This project is  a microservices-based application using Python and Docker, comprising two interconnected services. The Admin App, built with the Django framework and MySQL database, 
allows administrators to publish and manage images. The Main App, created using the Flask framework with a MySQL database, enables users to like images.
These applications are connected via RabbitMQ for efficient event-driven communication and utilize internal API calls for seamless interaction.
